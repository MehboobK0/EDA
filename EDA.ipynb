    "Q1: The key features of the wine quality dataset may include various chemical properties of the wines, such as acidity levels, residual sugar, density, pH, alcohol content, etc. Each of these features plays a crucial role in determining the quality of wine:\n",
    "\n",
    "Acidity levels: Acidity affects the taste and flavor profile of the wine. Too much acidity can make the wine taste sharp or sour, while too little can make it taste flat.\n",
    "Residual sugar: The amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation influences its sweetness. Higher residual sugar levels can result in sweeter wines.\n",
    "Density: Density is related to the concentration of substances in the wine, which can affect its body and mouthfeel.\n",
    "pH: pH levels influence the stability and balance of the wine. Wines with lower pH tend to be more acidic and age better.\n",
    "Alcohol content: Alcohol content contributes to the body, texture, and perceived warmth of the wine.\n",
    "Each of these features provides valuable information about the composition and characteristics of the wine, which can be used to predict its quality."

    "Q2: Handling missing data in the wine quality dataset can be crucial for accurate analysis and modeling. Different imputation techniques can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean/Median Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean or median of the respective feature. Advantages include simplicity and preservation of the overall distribution, while disadvantages include sensitivity to outliers and potential bias.\n",
    "Forward Fill/Backward Fill: Fill missing values with the preceding or succeeding value. Advantages include simplicity and preservation of temporal patterns, while disadvantages include potential propagation of errors.\n",
    "Model-based Imputation: Predict missing values using regression models trained on the complete data. Advantages include flexibility and potential accuracy, while disadvantages include complexity and reliance on the chosen model.\n",
    "The choice of imputation technique depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis."

    "Hypothesis Testing: Test hypotheses about the significance of different factors in influencing exam performance using techniques like t-tests, ANOVA, etc.\n",

    "Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize features to ensure that they have comparable scales and magnitudes.\n",

Features exhibiting non-normality may include those with skewed distributions, such as residual sugar or acidity levels. Transformations such as logarithmic transformation, square root transformation, or Box-Cox transformation can be applied to these features to improve normality and meet the assumptions of statistical models."

The minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance can be determined by examining the cumulative explained variance ratio of the principal components. The number of principal components selected should strike a balance between dimensionality reduction and preserving sufficient information for accurate modeling."
